# Stock-Price-Prediction-using-R:


The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early recommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial distress warning system for long-term shareholders. Forecasting accuracy is the most important factor in selecting any forecasting methods. Research efforts in improving the accuracy of forecasting models are increasing since the last decade. The appropriate stock selection, those are suitable for investment is a very difficult task.


# Aim of Project:


AIRIMA model is one of the most useful and accurate time series models in making predictions about future trends. In our case we will predict stock market prices using R programming language.



# Libraries:


### library(quantmod): 
Quantitative Financial Modelling Framework (use to load a variety of data from different sources).

### library(tseries):  
tseries stands for Time Series Analysis and Computational Finance. Imports: graphics, stats, utils, quadprog, zoo, quantmod,  and other statistical operations like ADF test, p value test.

### library(timeSeries): 
Basic functions such as scaling and sorting, sub-setting, mathematical operations, and statistical functions.

### library(forecast): 
Provides Methods and tools for displaying and analyzing univariate time series forecasts including exponential smoothing via state space models and automatic ARIMA modelling.


# Methodologies:


ARIMA Modeling(auto-regressive integrated moving average)- ARIMA models provide another approach to time series forecasting. Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used approaches to time series forecasting and provide complementary approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.


# Conclusion
We learned how to predict Apple stock prices using R programming language, perform financial modeling, and then use time series models in forecasting. There are various automated functions that can fit into models, which will give accurate results when fed with enough data.
